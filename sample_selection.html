  <p>The C3PO program aims to study a comprehensive sample of comoving stellar twins in the solar neighborhood. The selection criteria for the sample were carefully designed using data from Gaia EDR3 to ensure a focus on high-quality candidates for detailed chemical abundance analysis. As demonstrated by simulations from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884L..42K/abstract">Kamdar et al., 2019</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..118N/abstract">Nelson et al., 2021</a> (the pilot study of C3PO), as well as our Paper 1 (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.2181Y/abstract">Yong et al., 2023</a>), these selection criteria lead to a high probability of identifying conatal pairs. The following criteria were applied:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Spatial separation (Δs)</strong>: Δs &lt; 30 pc (~10^6.8 au) in 3D space
    <ul>
      <li>This cutoff value balances the number of available targets while limiting contamination from chance alignments and non-conatal pairs.</li>
      <li>Simulations and previous studies have shown that this spatial separation criterion increases the likelihood of selecting conatal pairs. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>3D velocity separation (Δv)</strong>: Δv &lt; 2.0 km/s in 3D space
    <ul>
      <li>This criterion helps to select comoving pairs with similar velocities, increasing the likelihood of them being conatal.</li>
      <li>The velocity separation cutoff has been validated by simulations and prior research to effectively identify conatal pairs. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaia color</strong>: 0.65 ≤ (BP - RP) ≤ 1.15 mag
    <ul>
      <li>The blue cutoff avoids fast-rotating stars, which can be challenging for accurate equivalent width measurements and precise stellar parameters.</li>
      <li>The red cutoff excludes cool stars, which have increased line blending that can affect the accuracy of equivalent width measurements. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaia color difference</strong>: |Δ(BP - RP)| &lt; 0.15 mag
    <ul>
      <li>This criterion ensures that the stars in a comoving pair have sufficiently similar effective temperatures, enabling high-precision differential abundance analysis. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaia absolute magnitude difference</strong>: |ΔM<sub>G</sub>| &lt; 1 mag
    <ul>
      <li>While allowing for different evolutionary stages to study atomic diffusion, this criterion keeps the surface gravities of the stars in a pair sufficiently close for high-precision abundance determinations. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gaia apparent magnitude</strong>: G mag &lt; 10 mag
    <ul>
      <li>This cutoff ensures a sufficiently large sample size that can be observed with 6-10m class telescopes. <br /> <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cluster and moving group removal</strong>: A ‘friends-of-friends’ algorithm was applied with a linking length of 1 pc in 3D space, removing all groups with five or more members.
    <ul>
      <li>This step effectively removes most known open clusters and moving groups, allowing the sample to focus on true wide binaries dispersed throughout the Milky Way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The application of these selection criteria to the Gaia EDR3 data resulted in a sample of <strong>283 co-moving pairs</strong>, primarily consisting of dwarfs and subgiants. High-resolution spectroscopic observations were obtained for a subset of <strong>125 pairs (250 stars)</strong>, making this the largest high-precision chemical abundance study of such objects to date.</p>
